        <p>
            Hello there, I'm Ethan — I recently finished my Master of Engineering degree 
            at the University of British Columbia, where I was part of the Electrical and 
            Computer Engineering (ECE) program. During my master’s, I focused heavily on 
            software engineering and machine learning, which has become a real passion of 
            mine over the past few years.
        </p>
        <p>
            My journey into machine learning started back in 2023, after I went through all 
            three of Stanford’s ML courses on Coursera. Those courses really sparked my 
            interest and pushed me to take additional ML-related electives during my undergrad, 
            which eventually led me to specialize in ML during my master's. Since then, I’ve 
            explored areas like reinforcement learning, large language models, transformers, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            I actually started programming way back in high school — I picked up JavaScript 
            in Grade 11 (around 2017) and haven’t stopped coding since. These days, Python is 
            my go-to language, but over the years I’ve worked with quite a few others too, including C, 
            C++, Java, Assembly, and even Verilog. I love building things and solving problems through code, 
            whether that’s in higher-level software or lower-level systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the past six years, I've been balancing university with work — I usually spent 
            my summers either working in industry or taking extra courses. My work experience 
            has mostly been in firmware and software development, giving me a solid foundation 
            across the stack.
