        <p>
            Hello there, I'm Ethan — I recently finished my Master of Engineering degree at the University of British Columbia, where I was part of the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) program. During my master’s, I focused heavily on software engineering and machine learning, which has become a real passion of mine over the past few years.
        </p>
        <p>
            My journey into machine learning started back in 2023, after I went through all three of Stanford’s ML courses on Coursera. Those courses really sparked my interest and pushed me to take additional ML-related electives during my undergrad, which eventually led me to specialize in ML during my master's. Since then, I’ve explored areas like reinforcement learning, large language models, transformers, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            I actually started programming way back in high school — I picked up JavaScript in Grade 11 (around 2017) and haven’t stopped coding since. These days, Python is my go-to language, but over the years I’ve worked with quite a few others too, including C, C++, Java, Assembly, and even Verilog. I love building things and solving problems through code, whether that’s in higher-level software or lower-level systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the past six years, I've been balancing university with work — I usually spent my summers either working in industry or taking extra courses. My work experience has mostly been in firmware and software development, giving me a solid foundation across the stack.

        <p>   Worked with a small team to design a medical wearable EEG and ECG device.
              Wrote C-code firmware for BLE functionality including: advertising, connecting, and ADC data transmission
              Wrote Python code for a desktop application to connect to the BLE device with a simple GUI.
              Utilized signal processing techniques to audibly play input signals and display FFT waveforms of data.</p>

        <p>   Used Unity for proof of concept of a VR test environment to train airplane pilots.
              Computer commands could be used to change different aspects of a VR cockpit including the windshield and various gauges to train pilots to identify broken instruments and fly with sub-optimal vision.
              A phone app was also made for proof of concept of adapting this program into a AR setting.</p>

        <p>   Worked with a small team to design an app to notify users of a sump pump status based on multiple coloured LED states.
              Wrote an Android camera app utilizing image and video frame processing with OpenCV to filter specific colours from an image.
              The system employed an AWS web server to store user information and made the sump pump status available online.</p>
